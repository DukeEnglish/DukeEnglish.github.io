I studied Information security in HUNAN Univerisity and Artificial Intelligence in the University of Edinburgh.
I am really interested in every aspect related with the applications of Artificial Intelligence. I admire that NLP is an interdisciplinary field, and to do interdiciplinary research, we need a discipline. Therefore, I look for collaborators from mathematics, machine learning, computer science, linguistic, and any other subjects. I don't expect you to be an expert in all of these firelds&mdash;few people are&mdash;but I do expect you to know 
something about all of them from a diverse of group of collaborators.

This is a pretty interesting idea.

## Academic seminar

I currently hold a little private academic seminar with a few friends. If you are interested in this kind of activity, please get in touch, we could hold another one around WANGJING.
