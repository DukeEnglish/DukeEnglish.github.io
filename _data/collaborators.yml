      During our collaboration Michael developed the most accurate known 
      parser for combinatory categorial grammar, a linguistically expressive 
      grammar formalism. After graduation Michael began working on neural
      translation, and is one of the key researchers behind Facebook's 
      <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1978007565818999/a-novel-approach-to-neural-machine-translation/">convolutional machine translation system</a>.  -
